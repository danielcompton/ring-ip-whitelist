  "Middleware that secures routes by IP whitelist. Checks the IP address of every request
  and denies access if requester is not in the whitelist.

  IP whitelisting can provide additional security, but can be spoofed or otherwise defeated.
  It shouldn't be the only line of defense for sensitive resources.

  * cidrs: a whitelist of CIDR strings or IP addresses. IP addresses are treated as a CIDR for
    the single address (e.g. a /32 for an IPv4 address). If the list is inside an atom
    then the whitelist will be updated when the atom changes.
  * ip-fn: function to extract the IP address. Defaults to `:remote-addr`
  * error-response: Response to return if request is not authorised
  * allow-access?: An additional function that can be provided if IP whitelisting fails but
    more checking is needed before denying access. Takes a request argument, returns true if
    the request should be allowed, else false. Note, if you're checking for a secret request parameter
    you probably shouldn't be, but if you still want to, make sure you do the comparison with a
    constant time equals, e.g. https://github.com/weavejester/crypto-equality"
